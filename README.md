# Recycle Rush
Recycle Rush is the 2015 FIRST Robotics Competition game. It involves picking up and stacking totes on scoring platforms, putting pool noodles ("litter") inside recycling containers, and putting the containers on top of scoring stacks of totes. There is also a coopetition aspect of the game where both alliances of teams can pool their totes and stack them on a step dividing the field to each gain 20 points. Along with these robot actions, human players can attempt to throw noodles ("litter") across the field to gain 4 points for each noodle left in the opposing alliance's work zone.
